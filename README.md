# The Battle of the Two Armies
A turn base game made in C++ using Allegro5 library. Made as a semestral project for the class Programování v C++ I at the University of South Bohemia. The goal of this game is to destroy enemies units. The game is controlled by mouse. You can change the settings of the game (including units and their images) in the settings.csv file.

Source files are in the \TheBattleOfTheTwoArmies folder. The settings.csv and Images folder should be copied to the directory with the executable.
Used IDE: Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

All images are from http://opengameart.org/ with public domain licence.

You need an Allegro5 library to compile it. (or there is a compiled .exe in the Release folder)
